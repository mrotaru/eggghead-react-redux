## Running

To run the code, just open `index.html` in a browser. No package
manager/bundler/etc is used, instead relying on CDNs or, for node modules,
on https://wzrd.in/. Give it some time on the first run, it can take a
while. The files composing the app are referenced with relative paths, and
for Chrome to allow loading of local files, we need to start it with a
flag:


  /c/Program\ Files\ \(x86\)/Google/Chrome/Application/chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files

Or, we can use Firefox which allows it "out-of-the-box".
